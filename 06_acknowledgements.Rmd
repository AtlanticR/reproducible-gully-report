# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS {#sec:acknowledgements}

Therefore the authors would like to heartily thank their many colleagues from the 
Bedford Institute of Oceanography and beyond. This includes the staff who 
filled the sea-going, field operations and data management roles, plus the 
officers and crew of the many Canadian Coast Guard and chartered vessels. Thank 
you for making the many AZMP monitoring missions through the years such a 
resounding success.

We also want to warmly thank the reviewers, Lindsay Beazley and Chantelle Layton, 
who provided feedback that was of great help in improving this document.
