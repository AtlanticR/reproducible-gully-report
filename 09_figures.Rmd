(ref:gully-map) Map of the Gully MPA with its three zones. The outline of Zone 2 The Gully MPA is defined within the outline of Zone 2. The four current monitoring stations are indicated by yellow-filled circles. Top-right map inset shows the position of the Gully MPA in relation to Atlantic Canada.

(ref:bio-fig5) Relationship between indices of development of the C. finmarchicus populations (percentage of CI-IIIs or CIVs in the population)and  sampling date (upper row) or 5 m temperature (lower row) at HL_06, GULD_03 and LL_07 in April between 1999 and 2018.  Note that outliers (circled in red) were excluded from the correlations between 5 m temperature and the percentage of CI-IIIs in the populations for GULD_03 and LL_07.  Equations and significance levels are shown for significant relationships only.
