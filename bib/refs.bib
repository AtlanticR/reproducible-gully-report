	abstract = {The spectral absorption coefficients of phytoplankton in oceanic waters were previously shown to vary with chlorophyll a concentration according to nonlinear relationships with a great deal of noise. We analyzed this biological noise on a data set of 596 simultaneous absorption and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment measurements acquired within the surface layer (first optical depth) from various regions of the world's oceans. We observed systematic deviations from the average relationships for some oceanic areas and also seasonally within given areas. Using the detailed HPLC measurements, the influences of pigment composition and package effect (the two main sources of variability in algal absorption for a given chlorophyll a concentration) were explicitly separated for each sample. It was found that while the pigment composition experiences large variations, even within a restricted chlorophyll range, it is often not (at least within the first optical depth) the dominant source of the biological noise. Instead, these deviations mostly result from variability in the pigment packaging effect (for a given chlorophyll a concentration) due to variations in algal community size structure. This conclusion is fully confirmed by an independent approach, which consists of estimating a “size index” of algal populations from the relative concentrations of taxonomic pigments.},

Several recent multidisciplinary projects focused on the study of canyons have considerably increased our understanding of their ecological role, the goods and services they provide to human populations, and the impacts that human activities have on their overall ecological condition. Pressures from human activities include fishing, dumping of land-based mine tailings, and oil and gas extraction. Moreover, hydrodynamic processes of canyons enhance the down-canyon transport of litter. The effects of climate change may modify the intensity of currents. This potential hydrographic change is predicted to impact the structure and functioning of canyon communities as well as affect nutrient supply to the deep-ocean ecosystem. This review not only identifies the ecological status of canyons, and current and future issues for canyon conservation, but also highlights the need for a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on canyon ecosystems and proposes other research required to inform management measures to protect canyon ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Sable Gully, a broad, shelf break submarine canyon approximately 40km east of Sable Island on the eastern Scotian Shelf, separates Banquereau and Sable Island Banks. Unique among canyons on the eastern Canadian continental shelf because of its depth, steep slopes and extension far onto the shelf, its ecological significance and increasing human pressures led to its designation in 2004 under Canada's Oceans Act as the first Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Atlantic Region. To improve the state of knowledge of the Gully MPA, a multi-disciplinary field program was carried out in 2006–07; the physical oceanographic component consisted of the deployment (April 2006) and recovery (August 2007) of four current meter moorings and CTD surveys. Analysis of this 16-month mooring deployment demonstrates that the mean circulation above the canyon rim (~200m) is characterized by a southwestward flow that appears unaffected by the canyon topography. There is also some indication of the existence of an eddy at rim depth. Below 500m, the circulation is dominated by an upcanyon flow (of order 0.02ms−1) at the mooring array (halfway between the canyon head and mouth). The mean, 200m-bottom transport towards the head of the Gully was estimated as 35,500m3s−1, implying an upwelling velocity of 1.7×10−4ms−1 (14md−1) over the area. Results also show bottom-intensified tidal flows and non-linear constituents due to the interaction of K1, O1, M2 and S2 components along the thalweg of the canyon; the strong overtides and compound tides observed in the Gully make it unique among canyons. Further analyses provide evidence of enhanced mixing in the Gully (Kv~180×10−4m2s−1), which is approximately 20 times that observed on the adjoining Scotian Shelf. Total variance of the currents in the Gully is about 2.5 times greater than that observed on the nearby continental slope with an equivalent water depth.}

	abstract = {The Gully is a large submarine canyon incised into the Scotian Shelf, in the northwest Atlantic. A submersible-mounted camera was used to collect 17km of high resolution video imagery of the soft sediment flanks and floor of the canyon between 1000 and 2500m depth. A depth-stratified random survey design with two transects per stratum was followed. Depth strata were drawn at 1000–1500m, 1500–2000m and 2000–2500m reflecting global and regional faunal boundaries. The 47,614 individuals or colonies observed on the transects were identified into 49 unique taxa drawn from 7 phyla, while 21 additional taxa were observed between the transect lines. Cnidaria was the most diverse phylum (22 taxa) on the transects, followed by the Echinodermata (15 taxa). Most fauna were sessile or sedentary suspension feeders. A species of Xenophyophorida, likely Syringammina sp., was the most abundant taxon. Cluster analysis of transects based on a Bray–Curtis ({BC}) matrix of species abundance identified one cluster of five transects and one independent transect – the deepest transect (2406m average depth). A similarity profile test indicated that this structure is not random. There was a significant change in the megafaunal assemblage with depth over scales of 10s of kilometers, accounting for 65\% of the variation in the {BC} matrix. Both total organic carbon and labile carbon were higher in cores from the 1000–1500m stratum than at greater depth, consistent with transport of food and sediments into the canyon from shallower waters. The first principal component calculated from species abundances separated the two transects from the 1000–1500m depth stratum from the others indicating that sediment food supply influences community structure and composition. Over small spatial scales (≤10m), eight groups of species associations were identified. However, the associations between the species within each group were not strong with the highest correlation between the Xenophyophorida and the Pennatulacea (ρ=0.66). At this spatial scale substrate type was an important factor, with hard and soft bottom species associations being identified.},

Yet it is not possible to determine whether these fluctuations are genuinely oscillatory from the relatively short observational record alone. Using a 1400 year climate model calculation, we are able to simulate the observed pattern and amplitude of the AMO. The results imply the AMO is a genuine quasi-periodic cycle of internal climate variability persisting for many centuries, and is related to variability in the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). This relationship suggests we can attempt to reconstruct past THC changes, and we infer an increase in THC strength over the last 25 years. Potential predictability associated with the mode implies natural THC and AMO decreases over the next few decades independent of anthropogenic climate change.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chl) seasonal cycles of the North Atlantic are described using satellite ocean color observations covering the 1980s and the 2000s. The study region is where warmer SST and higher Chl in the 2000s as compared to the 1980s have been reported. It covers latitudes from 30°N–50°N and longitudes from 60°W–0°W, where two phytoplankton blooms take place: a spring bloom that follows stratification of upper layers, and a fall bloom due to nutrient entrainment through deepening of the mixed layer. In the 1980s, spring and fall blooms were of similar amplitude over the entire study region. In the 2000s, the fall bloom was weaker in the eastern Atlantic (east of 40°W), because of a delayed deepening of the mixed layer at the end of summer (mixed layer depth (MLD) determined from in situ data). Conversely, the spring bloom of the eastern Atlantic was stronger in the 2000s than it was in the 1980s, because of a deeper MLD and stronger winds in winter. In the Northwestern Atlantic (northwest of 38°N–40°W), little differences are observed for spring and fall blooms, and for the wintertime MLD. Our results show that the links between upper layer stratification, SST changes, and biological responses are more complex than the simple paradigm that sequentially relates higher stratification with warmer SST and an enhanced (weakened) growth of the phytoplankton population in the subpolar (subtropical) region.},

	abstract = {Examination of temperature and salinity data from the Scotian Shelf, Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the adjacent continental slope has shown that the dominant low-frequency event over the last 45 years was a cooling and subsurface freshening of the water masses from 1952 to 1967, followed by a rapid reversal of these trends. The largest temperature and salinity changes (1952–1967) were 4.6°C and 0.7, respectively, and occurred at about 100 m over the slope. Exchanges with shelf waters and vertical mixing gave rise to the surface manifestation of this variability. The westward transport of the Labrador Current was found to have similar variability, increasing from about 1 × 106 m3 s−1 in the early 1950s to about 4 × 106 m3 s−1 in the mid-1960s. A simple model that accounts for this variation of transport and has a constant entrainment of North Atlantic water indicates that changes of the westward flow of the Labrador Current could contribute significantly to the T-S fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment of projected global and regional ocean temperature change is based on global climate models that have coarse (∼100 km) ocean and atmosphere resolutions. In the Northwest Atlantic, the ensemble of global climate models has a warm bias in sea surface temperature due to a misrepresentation of the Gulf Stream position; thus, existing climate change projections are based on unrealistic regional ocean circulation. Here we compare simulations and an atmospheric CO2 doubling response from four global climate models of varying ocean and atmosphere resolution. We find that the highest resolution climate model (∼10 km ocean, ∼50 km atmosphere) resolves Northwest Atlantic circulation and water mass distribution most accurately. The CO2 doubling response from this model shows that upper-ocean (0–300 m) temperature in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf warms at a rate nearly twice as fast as the coarser models and nearly three times faster than the global average. This enhanced warming is accompanied by an increase in salinity due to a change in water mass distribution that is related to a retreat of the Labrador Current and a northerly shift of the Gulf Stream. Both observations and the climate model demonstrate a robust relationship between a weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and an increase in the proportion of Warm-Temperate Slope Water entering the Northwest Atlantic Shelf. Therefore, prior climate change projections for the Northwest Atlantic may be far too conservative. These results point to the need to improve simulations of basin and regional-scale ocean circulation.},

The circulation and hydrography in the Gully have significant temporal and spatial variability. This paper presents a numerical study of the three-dimensional circulation and hydrography in the Gully using a multi-nested ocean circulation model. The model is forced by tides, wind stress and surface heat/freshwater fluxes. Model results are in fair agreement with the current and hydrographic observations made in the Gully in 2006 and 2007. A process study is conducted to examine the main physical processes affecting the circulation and hydrography, including tide-topography interaction, wind forcing, and the shelf-scale circulation over the eastern Canadian Shelf. The model results demonstrate that the circulation and hydrography above the canyon rim are influenced significantly by wind, particularly during storm events, while the subsurface flow over the shelf slope is affected by the shelf-scale circulation. There is also significant tide-topography interaction inside the Gully. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Sable Gully is a broad deep underwater canyon located to the east of Sable Island on the edge of the Scotian Shelf. Being the home of many marine species including the endangered Northern Bottlenose Whale, the Gully was designated as a marine protected area (MPA) in 2004. Better understanding of physical environmental conditions over this MPA is needed for sustainable ecosystem management. In this study, a multi-nested ocean circulation model and a particle tracking model are used to examine the three-dimensional (3D) circulation and movement of particles carried passively by the flow over the Sable Gully. The 3D circulation model is driven by tides, wind, and surface heat/freshwater fluxes. The model performance is assessed by comparing the results with the previous numerical tidal results and current meter observations made in the Gully. The simulated tidal circulation over the Gully and adjacent waters is relatively strong on shallow banks and relatively weak on the continental slope. Below the depth of the Gully rim ( ∼ 200 m), the tidal currents are constrained by the thalweg of the Gully and amplified toward the Gully head. The simulated subtidal circulation in the Gully has a complex spatial structure and significant seasonal variability. The simulated time-dependent 3D flow fields are then used in a particle tracking model to study the particle movements, downstream and upstream areas, and residence time of the Gully. Based on the movements of particles released at the depth of the Gully rim and tracked forward in time, the e-folding residence time is estimated to be about 7 and 13 days in February and August 2006, respectively. The Gully flanks are identified as high retention areas with the typical residence time of 10 and 20 days in February and August 2006, respectively. Tracking particles with and without tides reveals that tidal circulation reduces the value of residence time in the Gully, particularly along the Gully flanks.},

	abstract = { A brief summary of historical data relating to the mean circulation on the Scotian Shelf and Slope reveals the distribution of various water masses and certain general characteristics of the current field, supported by geostrophic calculations and observations of surface drift. However, extreme variability resulting from wind and tidal forces is evident in all measurements made on the shelf and slope. Various measurements and models of the first-order variable flows, including wind-driven circulation, diurnal and semidiurnal tides, and inertial waves, are also reviewed. Results from a new model for inertial motions in a variable-depth mixed layer are found to closely reproduce the transient behavior of inertial energy at the 50-m depth on the shelf, but certain aspects of the model are inconsistent with the observations. With results from a mooring program on the shelf in September–December 1968, the dynamics of the mean circulation are examined in the context of a vertically integrated, two-dimensional model. Reynolds stresses associated with the first-order flows are found to be insignificant in the inshore zone (within 90 km of the coast) where the balances are between mean wind and bottom stresses, surface pressure gradients, and Coriolis forces. Over the outer shelf, however, the geostrophic onshore balance breaks down and Reynolds stress divergences in the inertial and tidal bands become important. At the shelf break, generation of the baroclinic semidiurnal tide produces internal Reynolds stress forces comparable to the barotropic terms on the shelf.

    abstract = {{ Data from three cruises (Arabesque 1 and 2 cruises in the Arabian Sea and the Vancouver Island cruise) were examined to assess the importance of species composition and accessory pigments in modifying specific absorption coefficients. The three cruises differed widely in their phytoplankton assemblages with small cells dominating the Arabesque 2 cruise and large diatoms the Vancouver Island cruise. Absorption spectra from each cruise were decomposed into 13 Gaussian bands representing absorption by the major chlorophylls and accessory pigments. The maximum specific peak height Pm* for each Gaussian band was obtained by regressing Gaussian peak heights against the concentration of the pigment responsible for the absorption band. This relationship was generally non-linear and was fitted with a rectangular hyperbolic function. Changes in the maximum specific peak heights between cruises reflect changes in the packaging effect, which were most apparent at Gaussian bands of high absorption (400–490 nm), but were close to zero at the Gaussian band centered around 623 nm, associated with chlorophyll a (Chl a). The maximum specific peak height of this Gaussian band, Pm* (623), may be used to obtain reliable estimates of Chl a for any phytoplankton assemblage, unaffected by variations caused by the package effect. Comparing the Arabesque 2 peak heights with the Vancouver data, an apparent flattening effect of 0.42 at 440 nm and 0.62 at 676 nm was found for the Vancouver data relative to the Arabesque 2 data (assuming a zero flattening effect for the latter). Multiple linear regression analysis suggested that 29–42\\% of the variability in the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 440 nm was due to changes in pigment composition, while the remaining 58–71\\% was due to changes in the package effect. An inverse relationship was found between the proportion of non-photosynthetic pigments (NPC) and ambient Chl a concentration, suggesting that small cells (generally found in oligotrophic waters) had higher proportions of photoprotective pigments. }},
